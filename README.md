# React App for experiments with NATS

[NATS.io](https://nats.io/) is a connective technology built for the ever increasingly hyper-connected world. It is a single technology that enables applications to securely communicate across any combination of cloud vendors, on-premise, edge, web and mobile, and devices. NATS consists of a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed easily and independently. NATS is being used globally by thousands of companies, spanning use-cases including microservices, edge computing, mobile, IoT and can be used to augment or replace traditional messaging.

This application is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter and [NATS - Websocket Javascript Client for the Browser](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.ws)
